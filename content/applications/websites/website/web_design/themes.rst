Website themes
==============

Odoo offers numerous themes to shape your website's style and customize various options, including
colors, fonts, and layouts. When setting up your site using the Odoo website configurator, you are
prompted to select a theme that aligns with your desired aesthetic. If you wish to modify the theme
later, navigate to the website builder, click the :guilabel:`Edit` button, and access the
:guilabel:`Theme` tab.

Diverse sections are at your disposal, allowing you to tailor different aspects of your site to meet
your requirements.

- :guilabel:`Colors`: The Website Builder relies on palettes composed of five colors. Two
  :guilabel:`Main colors` apply to your site's primary and secondary elements, and three
  :guilabel:`Light & Dark` colors apply to your site's lightish, withish, and blackish colors.

  You can update the colors in the :guilabel:`Theme` tab of the editor later. From there, you can
  customize the :guilabel:`Color Presets` that have been defined automatically by the Website
  Builder based on the five previously defined color palettes. Each color preset contains a color
  for your site's :guilabel:`Background`, :guilabel:`Text`, :guilabel:`Headings`, :guilabel:`Links`,
  :guilabel:`Primary Buttons`, and :guilabel:`Secondary Buttons`. Click the arrow before a color
  preset to update it.

  Google map custom key, change the colors of the :guilabel:`Succes`, :guilabel:`Info`,
