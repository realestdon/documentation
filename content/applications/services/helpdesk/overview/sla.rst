Service Level Agreements (SLA)
==============================

A *Service Level Agreement* (SLA) defines the level of service a customer can expect from a
supplier. :abbr:`SLAs (Service Level Agreements)` provide a timeline that tells customers when they
can expect results, and keeps the support team on target.

Create a new SLA policy
=======================

To create a new :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` policy, navigate to the team's page under
:menuselection:`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`. Select a team, scroll to the
:guilabel:`Performance` section, and then check the selection box next to :guilabel:`SLA Policies`
to enable it for that specific team.

.. note::
   The value indicated next to the :guilabel:`Working Hours` field is used to determine the
   deadline for :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` policies. By default, this is determined by
   the value set in the :guilabel:`Company Working Hours` field under :menuselection:`Settings app
   --> Employees --> Work Organization`.

To create a new policy, click the :guilabel:`SLA Policies` smart button at the top of the team`s
settings page or go to :menuselection:`Helpdesk app --> Configuration --> SLA Policies`, and click
:guilabel:`New`. Start by entering a :guilabel:`Title` and a :guilabel:`Description` for the new
policy, and proceed to fill out the form using the steps below.

Define the criteria for an SLA policy
-------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`Criteria` section is used to identify which tickets this policy is applied to.

Fill out the following fields to adjust the selection criteria:

- :guilabel:`Team`: a policy can only be applied to one team. *This field is required.*
- :guilabel:`Priority`: the priority level for a ticket is identified by selecting one or more of
  the :guilabel:`⭐ (star)` icons representing the priority level on the kanban card or the ticket
  itself. The :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` will **only** be applied after the priority
  level has been updated on the ticket to match the :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` criteria.
  If no selection is made in this field, this policy will only apply to tickets marked as `Low
  Priority`, meaning those with zero stars.
- :guilabel:`Types`: ticket types indicate which tickets contain a customer question that can be
  solved with a quick response, or deal with an issue that may require additional investigation.
  Multiple ticket types can be selected for this field. If no selection is made, this policy will
  apply to all ticket types.
- :guilabel:`Tags`: tags are used to indicate what the ticket is about. Multiple tags can be applied
  to a single ticket.
- :guilabel:`Customers`: individual contacts or companies may be selected in this field.
- :guilabel:`Sales Order Items`: this field is available only if a team has the *Timesheets* app
  enabled. This allows the ticket to link directly to a specific line on a sales order, which must
  be indicated on the ticket in the :guilabel:`Sales Order Item` field.

.. note::
   Unless otherwise indicated, multiple selections can be made for each field. For example, multiple
   :guilabel:`Tags` can be included in a policy, but only one :guilabel:`Priority` level.

Establish a target for an SLA policy
------------------------------------

*Target* is the stage a ticket needs to reach, and the time alloted to reach that stage, in order to
satisfy the :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` policy. Any stage assigned to a team may be
selected for the :guilabel:`Reach Stage` field.

Time spent in stages selected in :guilabel:`Excluding Stages` will **not** be included in the
calculation of the :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` deadline.

.. example::
   An :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` titled `8 Hours to Close` tracks the working time before
   a ticket is completed, and would have `Solved` as the :guilabel:`Reach Stage`. However, an
   :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` titled `2 Days to Start` would track the working time
   before work on a ticket has begun, and would have `In Progress` as the :guilabel:`Reach Stage`.

Meeting SLA deadlines
=====================

As soon as it is determined that a ticket fits the criteria of an :abbr:`SLA (Service Level
Agreement)` policy, a deadline is calculated. The deadline is based on the creation date of the
ticket, and the targeted working hours. The deadline is then added to the ticket, as well as a tag
indicating the name of the :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` applied.

.. image:: sla/sla-open-deadline.png

When a ticket satisfies an :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` policy, the :abbr:`SLA (Service
Level Agreement)` tag turns green, and the :guilabel:`Deadline` disappears from view on the ticket.

.. important::
   If a ticket fits the criteria for more than one :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)`, the
   earliest occurring deadline will be displayed on the ticket. After that deadline has passed, the
   next deadline will be displayed.

.. image:: sla/sla-deadline.png

If the :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` deadline passes and the ticket has not moved to the
:guilabel:`Reach Stage`, the :abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` tag will turn red. After the
:abbr:`SLA (Service Level Agreement)` has failed, the red tag will stay on the ticket, even after
the ticket is moved to the :guilabel:`Reach Stage`.

Analyzing SLA performance
=========================

The :guilabel:`SLA Status Analysis` report tracks how quickly an :abbr:`SLA (Service Level
Agreement)` is fulfilled, as well as the performance of individual team members. Navigate to the
report and corresponding pivot table by going to :menuselection:`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> SLA
Status Analysis`.

Using the Pivot view
--------------------

By default, the report displays in a :guilabel:`Pivot` view. Any :abbr:`SLA (Service Level
Agreement)` policies in the database with tickets that failed to fulfill a policy, are in progress,
or have satisfied a policy are listed. By default, they are grouped by team, and ticket count.

To change the display, or to add additional measurements, click the :guilabel:`Measures` button to
reveal a drop-down menu of reporting criteria, and choose from the options available. Whenever a
measurement is picked, a check mark appears in the drop-down menu to indicate that the measurement
is included, and a corresponding new column will emerge in the pivot table to show the relevant
calculations.

To add a group to a row or column, click the :guilabel:`➕ (plus)` icon next to the policy name and
then select one of the groups. To remove one, click the :guilabel:`➖ (minus)` icon and deselect.

Using the Graph view
--------------------

The :guilabel:`SLA Status Analysis` report can also be viewed as a :guilabel:`Bar`,
:guilabel:`Line`, or :guilabel:`Pie` Chart. Toggle between these views by selecting the appropriate
icon at the top right of the chart.

.. tip::
   Both the :guilabel:`Bar Chart` and :guilabel:`Line Chart` can be viewed :guilabel:`Stacked`.
   This presents two or more groups to appear on top of each other instead of next to each other,
   making it easier to compare data.

Using the Cohort view
---------------------

The :guilabel:`Cohort` view is used to track the changes in data over a period of time. To display
the :guilabel:`SLA Status Analysis` report in a :guilabel:`Cohort` view, click the icon in the top
right corner above the chart.
