Use different units of measure
==============================

.. |UOM| replace:: :abbr:`UoM (Unit of Measure)`
.. |PO| replace:: :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)`
.. |RFQ| replace:: :abbr:`RFQ (Request for Quotation)`
.. |SO| replace:: :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`

In some cases, handling products in different units of measure is necessary. For example, a
business can buy products from a country that uses the metric system, and then sell those products
in a country that uses the imperial system, so the business needs to convert the units. Another
case for unit conversion is when a business buys products in a big pack from a supplier and then
sells those products in individual units.

Odoo can be set up to use different *units of measure (UoM)* for one product.

Configuration
=============

To use different units of measure in Odoo, first go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration
--> Settings` and under the :guilabel:`Products` section, activate the :guilabel:`Units of Measure`
setting. Then, click :guilabel:`Save`.

Units of measure categories
===========================

After enabling the units of measure setting, view the default units of measure categories in
:menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> UoM Categories`. The category is important for unit
conversion — Odoo can convert a product's units from one unit to another only if both units belong
to the same category.

Each units of measure category has a reference unit. The reference unit is highlighted in blue in
the :guilabel:`Uom` column of the :guilabel:`Units of Measure Categories` page. Odoo uses the
reference unit as a base for any new units.

To create a new unit, first select the correct category. For example, to sell a product in a box of
six units, click on the :guilabel:`Unit` category line.

After that, click :guilabel:`Add a line`. Then, in the :guilabel:`Unit of Measure` field, title the
new unit `Box of 6`. In the :guilabel:`Type` field, select :guilabel:`Bigger than the reference Unit
of Measure`. In the :guilabel:`Ratio` field, enter `6.00000` since a box of six is six times bigger
than the reference unit (`1.00000`). Finally, click :guilabel:`Save`.

Specify a product's units of measure
====================================

To set units of measure on a product, first go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Products -->
Products` and select a product to open its settings.

In the :guilabel:`General Information` tab, edit the :guilabel:`Unit of Measure` field to specify
the unit of measure that the product is sold in. The specified unit will also be the unit used to
keep track of the product's inventory and internal transfers. Edit the :guilabel:`Purchase UoM`
field to specify the unit of measure that the product is purchased in.

Unit conversion
===============

Buy products in the Purchase UoM
--------------------------------

When creating a new request for quotation (RFQ) in the *Purchase* app, Odoo automatically uses the
product's specified purchase unit of measure. If needed, the :guilabel:`UoM` can be manually edited
on the |RFQ|.

After the |RFQ| is confirmed into a purchase order (PO), click the :guilabel:`Receipt` smart button
at the top-right corner of the |PO|. Odoo automatically converts the purchase unit of measure into
the product's sales/inventory unit of measure, so the :guilabel:`Demand` column of the delivery
receipt shows the converted quantity.

For example, if the product's purchase |UOM| is `Box of 6` and its sales/inventory unit of measure
is `Units`, the |PO| shows the quantity in boxes of six, and the receipt (and other internal
warehouse documents) shows the quantity in units.

Replenishment
-------------

A request for quotation for a product can also be generated directly from the product form using
the :guilabel:`Replenish` button.

After clicking :guilabel:`Replenish`, a replenish assistant box pops up. The purchase unit of
measure can be manually edited in the :guilabel:`Quantity` field, if needed. Then, click
:guilabel:`Confirm` to create the |RFQ|.

.. important::
   A |PO| can only be automatically generated if at least one vendor is listed in the product form's
   :guilabel:`Purchase` tab.

.. image:: uom/replenish.png

Navigate to the created |PO| by clicking the :guilabel:`Forecasted` smart button on the product
form. Scroll down to :guilabel:`Forecasted Inventory` section, and in the :guilabel:`Requests for
quotation` line, click the |RFQ| reference number to open the draft |RFQ|. If necessary, the
purchase |UOM| can be edited directly on the |PO|.

Sell in a different UoM
-----------------------

When creating a new quotation in the *Sales* app, Odoo automatically uses the product's specified
unit of measure. If needed, the :guilabel:`UoM` can be manually edited on the quotation.

After the quotation is sent to the customer and confirmed into a sales order (SO), click the
:guilabel:`Delivery` smart button at the top-right corner of the |SO|. Odoo automatically converts
the unit of measure into the product's inventory unit of measure, so the :guilabel:`Demand` column
of the delivery shows the converted quantity.

For example, if the product's |UOM| on the |SO| was changed to `Box of 6`, but its inventory unit of
measure is `Units`, the |SO| shows the quantity in boxes of six, and the delivery shows the quantity
in units.
